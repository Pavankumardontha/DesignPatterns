Lets consider we have a weather station which keeps track of temperature and humidity at each place. There are some IOT sensors installed at various 
centres. These are used to record the temperature and humidity of a particular place and update them to wheather station. Wheather station will have 
Setparameter(double temperature , double humidity) which is called by the IOT device to update the temperature and humidity. Wheather station just keeps 
track of these parameters but does not know what to do with these parameters. Lets say there is system-1 which displays current temperature and humidity.
Lets say there is another system-2 which displays average temperature and humidity based on the past records.So whenever there is some change in temperature
or humidity , the IOT devices update to the weather station which inturn should update system-1 and system-2. 
In our case , wheather station is called subject/observable. Systems-1,2 are called observers. They observe the weather station. So we have some 
observable/subject which has a state associated with it.Whenever the state of this observable/subject changes , it has to update to its observers which 
are system-1 and system-2.
How will the observable know who are the observers it needs to notify about the change in its state ?? These observers somehow must subscribe to the 
observable. So the observable exposes 2 methods 
a) Registerobserver()
b) Removeobserver()
c) notifyobservers()

On the otherhand, observers just need to have one method which will be executed when there is a change in the state of the observable. 
a) update()

Whenever an observable wants to notify to each of its observers it calls their update methods. !!
