/*
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients 
expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible 
interfaces.
*/

A common real-world use case for the Adapter Pattern is integrating multiple payment 
gateways (like PayPal, Stripe, or a legacy bank system) into a single unified interface.
Scenario:
Your e-commerce app needs to support multiple payment methods, but each payment provider 
has a different interface. Instead of rewriting your code for each provider, you use 
Adapters to make them work uniformly.

/*
how to use the above concrete classes which does not implement our expected interface ?
Option-1 : We change our interface to adhere to different gateway interfaces. This is a very 
bad approach since each gateway processor has different method naming for same underlying
functionality
Option-2 : We tell the gateways to adopt our expected interface. This is bad since the 
gateway classes are vendor classes and we cannot impose conditions on them.

Option-3 : Create Adaptors for each payment gateway which we can use to convert the payment
gateway interfaces to our expected payment processing interface. This is the best approach
